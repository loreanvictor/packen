[**`packen`**](.) collects [isomorphic JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript) code when it runs on the server, and prepares it for shipping to and running on the client. Useful for server side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), etc.

```js
// isomorphic code:
import { packMe } from 'packen'

packMe()

// ...
```
```bash
node -r packen/r server-code.js
```

<br>

- ☕&ensp;_Simple_: mark isomorphic code, [**`packen`**](.) does the rest
- 🧠&ensp;_Smart_: only ship what you need with [conditional bundling](#usage)
- 🛠️&ensp;_Flexible_: integrate [**`packen`**](.) [with your own toolchain](#bundling)
- 🧩&ensp;_Extensible_: write your own [custom processors](#extension)

<br>

# Installation

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for using `packen`.

```bash
npm i packen
```

<br>

# Usage

To use [**packen**](.), you need to:

- Mark your isomorphic code
- Run your server code, which may use (some of) your isomorphic code

[**packen**](.) will keep track of what was used and bundle it for you (or help you bundle it using your own toolchain).

<br>

👉 Use `packMe()` to mark your isomorphic code:

```js
import { packMe } from 'packen'

packMe()
// this file will be included in the bundle
```

You can also conditionally mark a file:

```js
if (condition()) {
  packMe()
}

// this file will be included in the bundle
// only if condition() is true.
```
```js
export function func() {
  packMe()
  // this file will be included in the bundle
  // only when func() is called.
  
  // ...
}
```
<br>

You can create the bundle either programmatically or using the CLI. [**packen**](.) is mainly designed to be used programmatically (as part of other tooling), but the CLI route offers a convenient out-of-the-box method suitable for static site generation (SSG), albeit with limited configuration options.

<br>

## CLI

```bash
node -r packen/r sever_code.js
```
```bash
ts-node -r packen/r server_code.ts
```

<br>

☝️ This will execute `server_code.js`, and bundle any [marked](#usage) isomorphic code in an output `bundle.js`. You can customize the output file by providing the `PACKEN_TO` environment variable:

```bash
PACKEN_TO=dist/chunk.js node -r packen/r server_code.js
```
```bash
PACKEN_TO=dist/chunk.js ts-node -r packen/r server_code.ts
```


<br>

## Programmatic API

```js
import { Bundle, build } from 'packen/server'

//
// 👉 STEP 1: create a bundle
//
const bundle = new Bundle()

//
// 👉 STEP 2: run your isomorphic code
//
import './my/iso.js'

...

//
// 👉 STEP 3: build the bundle
//
await build(bundle, 'dist/chunk.js')
```

<br>

A `Bundle` MUST have been created before the isomorphic code is executed. Calling `packMe()` when no bundle is created will have no effect. Additionally, when you build a bundle, it is _closed_, which means it can no longer collect isomorphic code, and you need to make a new bundle.

<br>

[**`packen`**](.) provides various methods for building bundles:

- [`build()`](#build): creates a bundle from collected code using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) and writes it to given file.
- [`pack()`](#pack): creates a bundle from collected code using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) and returns it as a string.
- [`write()`](#write): creates an entry point from collected code and writes it to given file. You might need to bundle this entry file using your own bundler before shipping it to client (tools such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) can consume it directly).
- [`serialize()`](#serialize): creates an entry point from collected code and returns it as a string.

<br>

### Build

```ts
build(bundle: Bundle, path: string, processor?: Processor): void
```

Builds given bundle, bundles and minifies it (using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io)) and writes it to given path. If a processor is provided, will be used for processing earmarked entries (see [Extension](#extension)).

```js
import { Bundle, build } from 'packen/server'

const bundle = new Bundle()

// ...

build(bundle, 'dist/bundle.js')
```

<br>

### Pack

```ts
pack(bundle: Bundle, processor?: Processor): string
```

Builds given bundle, returning the bundled and minified code as a strin (uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io)). If a processor is provided, will be used for processing earmarked entries (see [Extension](#extension)).

```js
import { Bundle, pack } from 'packen/server'

const bundle = new Bundle()

// ...

const code = pack(bundle)
```

<br>

This method can be used for generating server-side HTML:

```js
const myHTML = html`
  <html>
    <head>
      <script type="module">
        ${pack(bundle)}
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- ... -->
    </body>
  </html>
`
```

<br>

### Write

```ts
write(bundle: Bundle, path: string, processor?: Processor): void
```

Builds an entry file for given bundle, and writes it to given path. If a processor is provided, will be used for processing earmarked entries (see [Extension](#extension)). DOES NOT bundle or minify the code.

```js
import { Bundle, write } from 'packen/server'

const bundle = new Bundle()

// ...

write(bundle, 'dist/entry.js')
```

<br>

This entry file can be used with other bundlers, like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev):

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script type="module" src="dist/entry.js"></script>
<!-- ... -->
```
```bash
vite build
```

<br>

### Serialize

```ts
serialize(bundle: Bundle, processor?: Processor): string
```

Builds an entry file for given bundle, returning the code as a string. If a processor is provided, will be used for processing earmarked entries (see [Extension](#extension)). DOES NOT bundle or minify the code.

```js
import { Bundle, serialize } from 'packen/server'

const bundle = new Bundle()

// ...

const code = serialize(bundle)
```

<br>

This is particularly useful when you want to use other bundlers programmatically (or even using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) with some custom configuration):

```js
import { build } from 'esbuild'

  await build({
    stdin: {
      contents: serialize(bundle, processor),
      resolveDir: process.cwd(),
    },
    // your esbuild configuration
  })
```

<br>

# Extension

By default, [**packen**](.) will use bare imports, collecting files as side-effect:

```js
// entry file

import '/Path/to/some/isomorphic.js'

// ...
```

<br>

You can change this behavior by providing a _processor_ function to bundling functions. This processor will be passed a [`CallSite`](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-JavaScript/interfaces/_node_modules__types_node_globals_d_.nodejs.callsite.html), and should turn it into some valid JavaScript string. For example, the following custom processor allows collecting specific functions, which then will be executed on client side:

```js
export dryRun = entry => {
  const func = entry.getFunctionName()
  const file = entry.getFileName()
  
  return `
    import { ${func} } from '${file}';
    ${func}();
  `
}
```

<br>


This processor can be used like this:

```js
// ...

build(bundle, 'dist/bundle.js', dryRun)
```
```js
// isomorphic code

import { packMe } from 'packen'

export const myFunc = () => {

  // this function will be collected for client side bundling
  // and executed on client bootstrap.
  packMe()
  
  // do other stuff
}
```

<br>

# Contribution

You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to start and [git](https://git-scm.com) to start.

```bash
# clone the code
git clone git@github.com:loreanvictor/packen.git
```
```bash
# install stuff
npm i
```

Make sure all checks are successful on your PRs. This includes all tests passing, high code coverage, correct typings and abiding all [the linting rules](https://github.com/loreanvictor/quel/blob/main/.eslintrc). The code is typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Jest](https://jestjs.io) is used for testing and coverage reports, [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io) are used for linting. Subsequently, IDE integrations for TypeScript and ESLint would make your life much easier (for example, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) supports TypeScript out of the box and has [this nice ESLint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)), but you could also use the following commands:

```bash
# run tests
npm test
```
```bash
# check code coverage
npm run coverage
```
```bash
# run linter
npm run lint
```
